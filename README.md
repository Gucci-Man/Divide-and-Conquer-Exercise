The following are functions that demmostrate the divide and conquer algorithm. Tests are ran with jest. 

1. countZeroes

    Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s, countZeroes returns the number of zeroes in the array.

2. sortedFrequency

    Given a sorted array and a number, sortedFrequency counts the occurrences of the number in the array.

3. findRotatedIndex

    findRotatedIndex accepts a rotated array of sorted numbers and an integer. The function should return the index of num in the array. If the value is not found, return -1.

4. findRotationCount

    findRotationCount accepts an array of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order. The array has been rotated counter-clockwise n number of times. Given such an array, find the value of n.

5. findFloor

    findFloor accepts a sorted array and a value x, and returns the floor of x in the array. The floor of x in an array is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. If the floor does not exist, return -1.
